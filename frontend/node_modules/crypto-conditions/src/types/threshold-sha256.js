/**
 * THRESHOLD-SHA-256: Threshold gate condition using SHA-256.
 *
 * Threshold conditions can be used to create m-of-n multi-signature groups.
 *
 * Threshold conditions can represent the AND operator by setting the threshold
 * to equal the number of subconditions (n-of-n) or the OR operator by setting
 * the thresold to one (1-of-n).
 *
 * Since threshold conditions operate on conditions, they can be nested as well
 * which allows the creation of deep threshold trees of public keys.
 *
 * By using Merkle trees, threshold fulfillments do not need to to provide the
 * structure of unfulfilled subtrees. That means only the public keys that are
 * actually used in a fulfillment, will actually appear in the fulfillment,
 * saving space.
 *
 * One way to formally interpret a threshold condition is as a booleanthreshold
 * gate. A tree of threshold conditions forms a boolean threshold circuit.
 *
 * THRESHOLD-SHA-256 is assigned the type ID 2. It relies on the SHA-256 and
 * THRESHOLD feature suites which corresponds to a feature bitmask of 0x09.
