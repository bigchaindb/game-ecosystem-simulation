It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n     *\n     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>\n     * const sumObserver = {\n     *   sum: 0,\n     *   next(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,\n     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n     *   complete() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n     *   }\n     * };\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n     * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>\n     * let sum = 0;\n     *\n     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n     * .subscribe(\n     *   function(value) {\n     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n     *     sum = sum + value;\n     *   },\n     *   undefined,\n     *   function() {\n     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n     *   }\n     * );\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // \"Adding: 1\"\n     * // \"Adding: 2\"\n     * // \"Adding: 3\"\n     * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>\n     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n     *   num => console.log(num),\n     *   undefined,\n     *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n     * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n     *\n     *\n     * setTimeout(() => {\n     *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n     *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n     * }, 2500);\n     *\n     * // Logs:\n     * // 0 after 1s\n     * // 1 after 2s\n     * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n     *\n     *\n     * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n     *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n     *  Observable.\n     * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.
